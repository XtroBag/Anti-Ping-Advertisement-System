🎀 Welcome to my python ANTI Ping/advertising system.

🔔 So your sick of all of thoese people pinging you in your server? oh well this is your sloution! All you gotta do is download the file and then add your info into the bot aka like your bots token, ID's and a bit more but it's very easy to setup i've made some notes in the file so you know what to put in the spots where i typed in my messages so it should not be hard for you to use. 

 🔒 Btw i'm sorry if i might have messed stuff up because i'm not the BEST in python i know more about javascript but thanks for understanding.

⚠️ The bots deafault prefix is [!] so make sure to read the file and change it also to what you might want it to be too!
